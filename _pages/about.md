## Why Mozilla
https://www.flickr.com/photos/mozfest/22893189741/

At Mozilla, we’re a global **community** of technologists, thinkers and builders **working together** to **keep the Internet alive and accessible**, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the Web.

Our **mission** is to ensure the Internet is a **global public resource, open and accessible to all**. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.

We believe that students are uniquely positioned to make a difference in the world and that by bringing together local groups who care about the internet we can achieve great things.

## Why Mozilla Clubs

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/photo_clubs.jpg" alt="Mozilla Clubs" class="text-center">

A Mozilla Club brings people together locally to **teach**, **protect** and **build** the open web in an engaging and collaborative way.

The Internet is more than computers and code. The Internet is about people. And this is what Mozilla Clubs are all about: interacting with others to share, learn, teach, protect and build upon platforms, to make things that matter. Our Clubs are human structures that make the web real.

There are different streams of Mozilla Clubs depending on whether they are on a University/College Campus or not:

* **Non-Campus Clubs**: These clubs are local groups who meet regularly in-person to learn how to read, write and participate on the Web. These Clubs can operate as afterschool programs, community meet-ups, as part of library or classroom programs, or in many other ways. To learn more about non-campus Mozilla Clubs click [here](https://teach.mozilla.org/clubs/). 
* **Campus Clubs**: These clubs take advantage of the unique learning environments of Universities and Colleges to bring groups of students together to teach, build and protect the open web. All clubs operating on University and College campuses are part of Campus Clubs. 

## Campus Clubs Vision

Imagine the highest quality university student programs you’ve ever heard of. Programs that **incite invention, inspire innovation,** and **foster global change**.

Now imagine a Mozilla program that engaged students all over the world, building campus groups that each have hundreds of passionate volunteers contributing to Mozilla as advocates, technologists/innovators and teachers. Now imagine that these groups were on thousands of University campuses in hundreds of countries.  

That is the vision for Campus Clubs. To spark a movement -- a loud voice, a breeding ground for new ideas, a massive force, a deep talent pool -- that powers Mozilla’s mission to new heights.

Mozilla Campus Clubs have three impact areas: advocacy (defend), technology (build), and web literacy (teach). 

At the start of each year, Campus Clubs plan on the impact they want to make in each area and use a combination of recommended activities and their own programs to make a difference in that area for their campuses and communities. 

## Roles in Campus Clubs

Passionate, dedicated leaders are key to the success of Campus Clubs. As they support and grow their communities they'll also grow their own knowledge and skills, learn more about open and become part of a network of leaders and doers who support and challenge them.

## History of Mozilla on Campus

Long before Mozilla’s first formal student program, “Campus Reps”, opened it’s doors in 2008,  students have been playing a crucial role in the development of Mozilla and the web itself. 

The student-built [Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29) browser was one of the first and [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28web_browser%29) (Firefox’s distant ancestor!), pioneered by students and staff, opened the graphical web to millions. Many of the original community members who worked on the first firefox in 2002 were students just like you. 

A lot has happened on Campuses since then:

* In 2012 the [Firefox Student Ambassador Program](https://wiki.mozilla.org/StudentAmbassadors) opened it’s doors to bring together individuals with a passion for Mozilla who wanted to raise awareness about the many benefits of Firefox & other Mozilla products.
* In 2013 the first [Maker Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oko6TzPQE6Y) moved students all around the world to come together to teach the web. 
* In 2015 the [Clubs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/2015/Mentors/Clubs) program started with a mandate to engage people around the world in ongoing web literacy programs
* In 2015 Mozilla Science started offering [Study Groups](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/introducing-mozilla-science-study-groups) for graduate students, researchers, and scientists looking to learn together. 
* In 2016 hundreds of students around the world led the [Take Back the Web Campaign](https://takebacktheweb.mozilla.community/2016/07/11/seven-weeks-take-back-web/) on their campuses to shift attitudes and change behavior around privacy and security online. 

By 2016, Campuses were starting to look a little crowded… as George Roter wrote in [his blog](https://georgeroter.org/2016/05/17/reinventing-mozilla-on-campus/): 

 *“The existing engagement on University campuses around the world is an assortment of largely disconnected programs and people. Firefox Student Ambassadors and Firefox Clubs. Mozilla Clubs. Code contribution by individual contributors. Maker Party. Mozilla Science Lab. Various professor and lab partnerships. Employee recruitment. Many of these are successful in their own right; there’s an opportunity learn from each of them, find connections, and imagine opportunity to scale their impact with a more coordinated approach.”*

And so we set about the process of [reinventing Mozilla on Campus](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/reinventing-mozilla-on-campus/8730/9). Through several months of research, discussion, investigation, hard decisions, and careful consideration the Campus Clubs program was born as a way to finally create a **unified model for participation on campuses around the world**.
