## What is a Mozilla Campus Club?

Mozillaâ€™s mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all.
A Mozilla University & College Club is a group of students who meet regularly to advance this mission by leading and participating in activities that teach, build, and protect the web in an inclusive, engaging way.
